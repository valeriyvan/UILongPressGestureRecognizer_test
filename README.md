This repo is my answer to Stackoverflow question by the link http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12687286/detect-touch-on-uiimageview-in-a-customcell/12689070#12689070.

Example shows UITableViewCell with custom UIImageView with UILongPressGestureRecognizer attached to latter.

Have a look at ViewController.m. Everything is selfexplanatory.

While testing, don't forget to LOOOOOOOOOONG test on image.
